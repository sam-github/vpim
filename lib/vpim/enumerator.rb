  # This is a way for an object to have multiple ways of being enumerated via

  # standard APIs such as Enumerable#map(), Enumerable#to_a(), and
  # Enumerable#find_all() can be used on it.

  # TODO since 1.8, this is part of the standard library, I should rewrite vPim
  # so this can be removed.

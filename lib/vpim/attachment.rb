  # Attachments are used by both iCalendar and vCard. They are either a URI or
  # inline data, and their decoded value will be either a Uri or a Inline, as
  # appropriate.
  #
  # Besides the methods specific to their class, both kinds of object implement
  # a set of common methods, allowing them to be treated uniformly:
  # - Uri#to_io, Inline#to_io: return an IO from which the value can be read.
  # - Uri#to_s, Inline#to_s: return the value as a String.
  # - Uri#format, Inline#format: the format of the value. This is supposed to
  #   be an "iana defined" identifier (like "image/jpeg"), but could be almost
  #   anything (or nothing) in practice.  Since the parameter is optional, it may
  #   be "".
  #
  # The objects can also be distinguished by their class, if necessary.

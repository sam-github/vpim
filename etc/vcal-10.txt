Section 1 : Introduction
[DS1]		
Personal Data Interchange (PDI) occurs every time two or more individuals communicate, in either a business or personal context, face-to-face, or across space and time. Such interchanges frequently include the exchange of informal information, such as business cards, telephone numbers, addresses, dates and times of appointments, etc. Augmenting PDI with electronics and telecommunications can help ensure that information is quickly and reliably communicated, stored, organized and easily located when needed.
Personal information, by nature, is complex and diverse. Currently, proprietary standards exist to structure some types of PDI information, but no single, open specification comprehensively addresses the needs of collecting and communicating PDI information across many common communication channels such as telephones, voice-mail, e-mail, and face-to-face meetings. versit  is developing a comprehensive family of PDI technologies based on open specifications and interoperability agreements to help meet this technology need.
Overview
This specification defines a format for an electronic calendaring and scheduling (vCalendar) format. The vCalendar format allows for the capture of information normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such as a Personal Information Manager or a Group Scheduling product.
The format is suitable as an interchange format between applications or systems. The format is defined independent of the particular method used to transport it. The transport for this exchange might be a file system, point-to-point asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of unwired transport.
A vCalendar is a data stream consisting of one or more vCalendar objects. The individual vCalendar definitions can be identified and parsed within the data stream. The vCalendar data stream may exist as a persistent form in a file system, document management system, network connection between two network endpoints, or in any other digital transport that has an abstraction of a stream of bytes.
Conceptually, a vCalendar Writer creates vCalendar data streams and a vCalendar Reader interprets vCalendar data streams. The vCalendar Reader and Writer may be implemented as a single application or as separate applications. It is not the intent of this specification to define the implementation of these processes beyond some fundamental capabilities related to the format of the vCalendar data stream and a common set of conformance requirements.
This specification provides for a clear-text encoding. The specification also includes a formal grammar for the clear-text encoding to aid in the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the descriptive prose definition of the specification.
The clear-text encoding of this specification can be used in environments which are constrained to 7-bit transfer encodings, short line lengths, and low bandwidth. In addition, the encoding is simple in order to facilitate the implementation of reader and writer applications on small platforms, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), cellular telephones, or alphanumeric pagers.
Scope
The vCalendar is intended to be used for exchanging information about event and todo types of calendaring and scheduling entities. An event is a calendaring and scheduling entity that represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it may be an activity; such as a one-hour, department meeting from 8 AM to 9 AM, tomorrow. A todo is a calendaring and scheduling entity that represents an action-item or assignment. For example, it may be an item of work assigned to an individual; such as "turn in travel expense today".
In today's business environment, this information is typically kept on a paper-based day-planner or calendar. More and more, this type of information is being also managed within electronic Personal Information Manager or Group Scheduling products. It is appropriate, then that this specification define this information in terms of a paradigm based on a calendaring  and scheduling event and todo entities.
Prior to the introduction of the vCalendar specification, users of such applications typically had to re-key the original information, often transcribing it from paper day-planners, scraps of paper or electronic mail messages. With the advent of the vCalendar specification, this information can be exchanged in an automated and consistent fashion.
The basis for this specification have their origin in openly defined, industry specifications; such as the X.400 API Association's Calendaring and Scheduling API (CSA). In addition, this specification has capabilities that were derived from the experience of multi-vendor demonstrations of this capability.
The specification of all date and time values are defined in terms of the ISO 8601 standard for representation of dates and times. The ISO 8601 standard supersedes all other international standards defined at the time this specification was drafted.
Personal data applications such as Personal Information Managers (PIM) often provide an import/export capability using Comma Separated Value (CSV) or Tab Delimited Files (TDF) formats. However, these solutions do not preserve the intent of the originating application. When a CSV and TDF format is used by a PIM, the meta-data or semantics of the originating object are only apparent to a similar version of the originating application. Exchange of data between such applications is another important application of an industry-standard specification for an electronic calendaring and scheduling interchange format, such as the vCalendar specification.
This specification is intended to be used as a format for exchange of calendaring and scheduling information from one product to another. This exchange may take place using desktop application interaction techniques; such as a file system FILE-OPEN or FILE-SAVE-AS functions, an operating systems clipboard CUT or COPY or PASTE operations, or a user interface DRAG and DROP interaction. In addition, this exchange may take place using a wired or wireless network transport; such as LAN or WAN protocols, switched telephone circuits, IrDA-based infra-red "beaming" of data, or emerging cellular data services. In any of these example cases, the vCalendar format is intended to be a transport- and platform-independent format for exchanging calendaring and scheduling personal data.

Section 2 : vCalendar
[DS2]		
This section defines the semantics and syntax for encoding the vCalendar in a simple, clear-text encoding.
Encoding Characteristics
The following characteristics are specific to this encoding.
vCalendar Object
A vCalendar data stream may include one or more vCalendar objects. An individual vCalendar object is identified within a data stream by the appearance of the Begin vCalendar Delimiter:
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
The sentinel string must appear as the first characters in the data stream or the first characters on a line.
The vCalendar object is terminated by the appearance of the End vCalendar Delimiter as the first characters on a line:
END:VCALENDAR
The vCalendar object is a container for calendaring and scheduling entities. These can include either event or todo entities.
vEvent Object
A vEvent is a grouping of calendaring and scheduling properties that define an entity that represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it may be an activity; such as a one-hour, department meeting from 8 AM to 9 AM, tomorrow.
An individual vEvent entity is identified within a vCalendar object by the appearance of the delimiter:
BEGIN:VEVENT
The sentinel string must appear as the first characters on a line.
The vEvent entity is terminated with the appearance of the following delimiter string as the first characters on a line
END:VEVENT
The vEvent entity can not be nested within another vEvent or vTodo entity. If vEvent entities need to be related to each other or to a vTodo entity, they can specify relationship with the RELATED-TO property.
vTodo Object
A vTodo is a grouping of calendaring and scheduling properties that define an entity that represents an action-item or assignment. For example, it mayto 7-bit transfer encodings, short line lengths, and low bandwidth. In addition, the encoding is simple in order to facilitate the implementation of reader and writer applications on small platforms, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), cellular telephones, or alphanumeric pagers.
Scope

Would be represented in a Quoted-Printable encoding as:
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Project XYZ Final Review=0D=0A=
   Conference Room - 3B=0D=0A=
   Come Prepared.
Property parameter substrings are delimited by a field delimiter, specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-colon in a property parameter value must be escaped with a Backslash character (ASCII 92).
Compound property values are delimited by a field delimiter, specified by the Semi-colon character (ASCII decimal 59). A Semi-colon in a component of a compound property value must be escaped with a Backslash character (ASCII 92).
Encodings
The default encoding for the vCalendar object is 7-Bit. The default encoding can be overridden for an individual property value by using the "ENCODING" property parameter. This parameter value can be either "BASE64", "QUOTED-PRINTABLE", or "8-bit". This parameter may be used on any property.
Some transports (e.g., MIME based electronic mail) may also provide an encoding property at the transport wrapper level. This property can be used in these cases for transporting a vCalendar data stream that has been defined using a default encoding other than 7-bit (e.g., 8-bit).
Character Set
The default character set is ASCII. The default character set can be overridden for an individual property value by using the "CHARSET" property parameter. This property parameter may be used on any property. However, the use of this parameter on some properties may not make sense.
Any character set registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) can be specified by this property parameter. For example, ISO 8859-8 or the Latin/Hebrew character set is specified by:
DESCRIPTION;CHARSET=ISO-8859-8:...
Some transports (e.g., MIME based electronic mail) may also provide a character set property at the transport wrapper level. This property can be used in these cases for transporting a vCalendar data stream that has been defined using a default character set other than ASCII (e.g., UTF-8).
Language
The default language is "en-US" (US English). The default language can be overridden for an individual property value by using the "LANGUAGE" property parameter. The values for this property are a string consistent with RFC 1766, Tags for the Identification of Languages. This property parameter may be used on any property. However, the use of this parameter on some properties, such as PHOTO, LOGO, SOUND, TEL, may not make sense. Canadian French would be specified by this parameter by the following:
SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=fr-CA:...
Date and Time
The date and time values for all vCalendar properties are formatted as a string consistent with the ISO 8601 representation for combinations of dates and times. Either the basic or extended format is allowed. The use of UTC, rather than local time, should be used when ever possible in order to avoid time zone ambiguities. The format for the complete, basic representation of a date and time value is written in the following sequence of characters:
<year><month><day>T<hour><minute<second><type designator>
For example, 8:30 AM on April 15, 1996 local time would be written as:
19960415T083000
And the same time in UTC based time would be written as:
19960415T083000Z
Where a value needs to specify a sequence of date and time values, then the property value is a string made up of a list of date and time values, separated by the field separator. For example:
19960101T090000Z; 19960201T090000Z; 19960301T090000Z; 19960401T090000Z; ...
Time Duration
The values for time duration or periods of time for all vCalendar properties are formatted as a string conformant with the ISO 8601 basic representation for duration of time. A given duration of a period of time is represented by a character string consisting of the designator "P", optionally including the number of years followed by the designator "Y", optionally including the number of months followed by the designator "M", optionally including the number of weeks followed by the designator "W", optionally including the number of days followed by the designator "D". The sequence can also contain a time component preceded by the designator "T", optionally including the number of hours followed by the designator "H", optionally including the number of minutes followed by the designator "M", optionally including the number of seconds followed by the designator "S". For example:
P6W
A period of six weeks;
PT15M
A period of 15 minutes;
PT1H30M
A period of 1 hour and thirty minutes; or
P2Y10M15DT10H30M20S
A period of 2 years, 10 months, 15 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes, and 20 seconds.
Value Location
The default location of the property values is inline with the property. However, for some properties, such as those that specify multimedia values, it is efficient to organize the property value as a separate entity (e.g., a file out on the network). The property parameter "VALUE" can be specified to override the "INLINE" location of the property value. In the case of the vCalendar being transported within a MIME email message, the property value can be specified as being located in a separate MIME entity with the "CONTENT-ID" value; or "CID" for shorthand. In this case, the property value is the Content-ID for the MIME entity containing the property value. In addition, the property value can be specified as being located out on the network using the "URL" value. In this case, the property value is the Uniform Resource Locator for the Internet resource containing the property value. This property parameter may be used on any property. However, the use of this parameter on some properties may not make sense; for example the Version, Time Zone, Status, Priority, Mail Reminder, etc. properties. The following specifies a value not located inline with the vCalendar but out in the Internet:
ATTACH;VALUE=URL:http://www.abc.com/dir_photos/my_photo.gif

Binary Values
The vCalendar specification supports inclusion of binary information, such as computer graphic images (e.g., JPEG), digital audio (e.g., WAVE), or video graphic images (e.g., MPEG). The binary information can either be referenced with a Uniform Reference Locator (URL), referenced with a message using a MIME Content-ID of the MIME part that contains the content, or  placed inline in the vCalendar as the value of a property. Inline binary information is included as a property value after being character encoded using Base 64 (default) or Quoted-Printable encoding.
Basic Recurrence Rule Grammar
The specification of recurring events can be simplified by the use of a grammar or rule notation. This specification makes use of the Base Recurrence Rule Grammar from the XAPIA's CSA Specification.
A recurrence rule is a string or clear-text encoding of a recurrence specification. A recurrence rule is composed of several components. A rule begins with a frequency which describes the type of repeating event (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.). This is followed by an interval which indicates how often the frequency repeats (i.e., daily, every third day, etc.). This can be followed by optional frequency modifier information and either an end date or a duration. 
Below is the form of a typical rule. This example causes events to be generated every other week on Tuesday and Thursday, for 8 occurrences: 
W2 TU TH #4
Where, W is the Frequency, 2 is the Interval, TU and TH are the optional Frequency Modifiers, and #4 is the Duration.
The basic recurrence rule grammar supports six types of repetition. The six types follow the same form with only the frequency name and optional modifier information changing from one type of frequency to the next. 
Daily Rule
The daily rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an interval of a day or more. These can range from every day to every 200th day and beyond. The daily rule begins with the letter D followed by an interval (representing days) and an optional duration or end date. 
Some examples follow: 
Daily for 10 occurrences:
	D1 #10  
Daily until 12/24/94:
	D1 19941224T000000Z
Every other day - forever:
	D2 #0 
Every 10 days, 5 occurrences:
	D10 #5  
Weekly Rule
The weekly rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an interval of a week or more. The basic weekly rule has the same form as the daily rule except that the rule begins with a W and can contain an optional list of weekdays the events are generated on. For weekly rules, the interval represents weeks. Some examples follow:
Weekly for 10 occurrences:
	W1 #10
Weekly until 12/24/94:
	W1 19941224T000000Z 
Every other week - forever:
	W2 #0  
Weekly on Tuesday and 
Thursday for 5 weeks:
	W1 TU TH #5
Every other week on Monday Wednesday and Friday until 12/24/94:
	W2 MO WE FR 19941224T000000Z 
Monthly Rule
The monthly rule is used for specifying repeating events base on an interval of a month or more. There are two types of monthly recurrence rules. One for by-position and one for by-day. The by-position rule allows weekdays in the month to be specified in relation to their occurrence in the month. An example would be to specify the third Sunday of the month or the last Friday of the month. An occurrence specifier may be used in monthly by-position rules. The occurrence specifiers control which occurrence of a weekday in a month an event occurs on:
1+, 2+, ... 5+  for the first occurrence, second, ...fifth occurrence of the month.
1-, 2-, ... 5-  for the last occurrence, second to last occurrence, etc.
A 2+ FR SA would indicate the second occurrence of Friday and Saturday in the month. A 1- MO would indicate the first occurrence of Monday working from the end of the month backwards (i.e., the last occurrence). A 2- MO would be the second to the last Monday of the month.
A by-day rule allows actual day numbers to be specified such as the 12th day or 29th day.
The by-position rule begins with a MP and the by-day rule begins with a MD. The interval in monthly rules represents months. Some examples follow: 
Monthly on the 1st Friday for ten occurrences:
	MP1 1+ FR #10  
Monthly on the 1st Friday until 12/24/94:
	MP1 1+ FR 19941224T000000Z
Every other month on the 1st and last 
Sunday of the month for 10 occurrences:
	MP2 1+ SU 1- SU #10  
Every six months on the 2nd Monday 
thru Friday for 10 occurrences:
	MP6 2+ MO TU WE TH FR #10 
Monthly on the second last Monday of the month for 6 months:
	MP1 2- MO #6
Monthly on the third to the last day of the month, forever:
	MD1 3- #0
Monthly on the 2nd and 15th of the month for 10 occurrences:
	MD1 2 15 #10 
In the next example LD refers to "LastDay" in a monthly recurrence rule. Monthly on the 1st and last day of the month for 10 occurrences:
	MD1 1 LD #10 or MD1 1 1- #10
Every 18 months on the 10th thru 15th of the month for 10 occurrences:
	MD18 10 11 12 13 14 15 #10 
Monthly on the second to the last day for 5 months. So, if the start date is August 1996, the event would repeat on 8/30/96, 9/29/96, 10/30/96, 11/29/96, and 12/30/96:
	MD1 2- #5
Yearly Rule
The yearly rule is used for specifying repeating events based on an interval of a year or more. There are two types of yearly recurrence rules. One for by-month and one for by-day. The by-month rule allows specific months out of the year to be specified. The by-day allows specific days to be specified. In the by-month rule, the day in the month the rule is to occur on is determined from the initial appointment.
The by-month rule begins with a YM and the by-day rule begins with a YD. The interval in yearly rules represents years. Some examples follow: 
Yearly in June and July for 10 occurrences:
	YM1 6 7 #10  
Every other year on January, Feb, and March for 10 occurrences:
	YM2 1 2 3 #10
Every 3rd year on the 1st, 100th and 200th day for 10 occurrences:
	YD3 1 100 200 #10

Policies
The duration portion of a rule defines the total number of events the rule generates, including the first event. 
Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the next event time and date is derived from the Start Time entry attribute. 
If an end date and a duration is specified in the rule, the recurring event ceases when the end date is reached or the number of events indicated in the duration occur; whichever comes first. 
If the duration or an end date is not established in the rule (e.g., D4) the event occurs twice. That is D4 is equivalent to D4 #2. 
A duration of #0 means repeat this event forever. 
Using the occurrence specifier 5+ (e.g. 5th Friday) or 5- (e.g. 5th from last Friday) in a month that does not contain 5 weeks does not generate an event and thus does not count against the duration. The same applies to providing a day of the month that does not occur in the month. For example the 30th or 31st . 
The start time and date of an entry must be synchronized with one of the repeating events defined by its recurrence rule. The following is not allowed:

	Initial Appt Date:	7/1/94  (Friday) 
	Recurrence Rule:		W1 MO TH #5  

The following is acceptable:

	Initial Appt Date:	7/1/94  (Friday) 
	Recurrence Rule:		W1 MO FR #5  or W1 #5 
If the optional <occurrencelist> and <weekdaylist> information is missing from a <monthlybypos> occurrence the information is derived from the entry attributes. The <occurrence> used in the recurring event is a count from the beginning of the month to the entry date and the <weekday> used is the day of the week the entry is scheduled to occur on. 

If the <monthlybypos> occurrence  or <monthlybyday> occurrence does not list a week day (e.g., SU or day 10) in the rule, the week day is established from the entry attribute information. As an example the rule MP1 #3 used in an entry with a start date of 7/20/94 (which is the third Wednesday of the month) repeats on 8/17/94 which is the third Wednesday of the month.
vCalendar Properties
The following properties must appear after the BEGIN:VCALENDAR delimiter but before the occurrence of the BEGIN:VEVENT or BEGIN:VTODO delimiters. These properties apply to the vCalendar object as a whole; unless overridden by a property within the scope of an event or todo entity.
Daylight Savings Rule
This property is identified by the property name DAYLIGHT. This property defines the daylight savings time rule observed by the "home" calendar system that created the vCalendar entity.
Many locations adjust their standard time forward or backward by one hour, in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of daylight hours. Standard time is also known as Winter Time. Daylight savings time is also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain countries.
The property value consists of a sequence of components that define the daylight savings time rule. The value consists of the daylight savings time flag, followed by the daylight savings time offset, followed by the date and time that the daylight savings time begins, followed by the date and time that the daylight savings time ends, followed by the standard time designation, followed by the daylight savings time designation. The daylight savings time flag is TRUE if daylight savings time is observed, otherwise it is FALSE and no other components are specified. The daylight savings time offset value is specified in a manner consistent with ISO 8601. The property value is a signed numeric indicating the number of hours and possibly minutes from UTC. The date and time that the daylight savings time begins and ends is specified in a manner consistent with ISO 8601 date and time format. The standard time and daylight savings time designations correspond to the customary character designations.
The following are examples of this property:

The latitude represents the location north and south of the equator as a positive or negative real number, respectively. The following is an example of this property:
GEO:37.24,-17.87
Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Product Identifier
This property is identified by the property name PRODID. This property specifies the identifier for the product that created the vCalendar object. The vendor of the implementation should assure that this is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as an ISO 9070 FPI value. The following is an example of this property:
PRODID:-//ABC Corporation//NONSGML My Product//EN
Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Time Zone
This property is identified by the property name TZ. This property specifies the standard time zone of the "home" system that created the vCalendar object. The property value is specified in a manner consistent with ISO 8601. The property value is a signed numeric indicating the number of hours and possibly minutes from UTC. Time zones east of UTC are positive numbers. Time zones west of UTC are negative numbers. The following are examples of this property:

Classification
This property is identified by the property name CLASS. This property defines the access classification for the vCalendar entity. 
A calendar entity access classification is only one component of the general security system within a calendar application. It provides a method of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner intends for information within an individual calendar entry. The access classification of an individual vCalendar entity is useful when measured along with the other security components of a calendar system (e.g., user authorization, access rights, access role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual access classifications can not be completely defined by this specification. Additionally, due to the "blind" nature of most exchange processes using this specification, these entity classifications can not serve as an enforcement statement for a system receiving a vCalendar data stream. Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of the calendar owner for the access to the calendar entry.
The following is an example of this property:
CLASS:PUBLIC
The property can have the following values:

Description
Property Value

Indicates general, public access.
PUBLIC

Indicates restricted, private access.
PRIVATE

Indicates very restricted, confidential access.

Date/Time Created
This property is identified by the property name DCREATED. This property specifies the date and time that the vCalendar entity was created within the originating calendar system. This is not generally the same date and time that the vCalendar object was crearty is identified by the property name PALARM. The property defines a procedure reminder for the vCalendar entity. A procedure reminder is a procedure, or application executable that will be run as an alarm for the event. 
While this property has many useful purposes, implementors should be aware of the security implications of sending a vCalendar data stream containing this property. The security implications are similar to those associated with active messages within electronic mail.
The value for the procedure reminder consists of the Run Time, or the date and time that the reminder is to be executed; Snooze Time, or the duration of time after the Run Time that the reminder is to be dormant prior to being repeated; Repeat Count, or the number of times that the reminder is to be repeated; and the Procedure Name, or the path to the procedure to be run when the reminder is executed.

Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Related To
This property is identified by the property name RELATED-TO. The property is used to represent relationships or references between this vCalendar entity and another. The property value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of another vCalendar entity. This value would be represented in a vCalendar data stream by the UID property.
A linked relationship can be specified by a series of entities that each, in turn, refer to their parent entity. A group relationship can be specified by a number of entities that all refer to one common parent entity. 
Changes to a calendar entity referenced by this property may impact the related calendar entity. For example, if a group event changes it start or end date or time, then the related, dependent events will need to have their start and end dates changed in a corresponding way. This property is intended only to provide information on the relationship of calendar entities. It is up to the target calendar system to maintain this relationship.
The following is an example of this property:
RELATED-TO:<jsmith.part7.19960817T083000.xyzMail@host3.com>

When a vCalendar entity is created its sequence number is zero (ASCII decimal 48). It is incremented each time it is revised. The following is an example of this property:
SEQUENCE:1
Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Start Date/Time
This property is identified by the property name DTSTART. This property defines the date and time that the event will start. The date and time value is expressed in the complete representation, basic format as specified in ISO 8601. The time can either be in local or UTC based time. Events may have a start date/time but no end date/time. In that case, the event does not take up any time. The following is an example of this property:
DTSTART:19960401T235959
Support for this property is mandatory for implementations conforming to this specification.
Status
This property is identified by the property name STATUS. This property defines the status associated with the vCalendar entity. This property can be used when the ATTENDEE property is either not supported or not needed. The following is an example of this property:
STATUS:TENTATIVE
The property can have the following values:

Description
Property Value

Indicates todo was accepted
ACCEPTED

Indicates event or todo requires action
NEEDS ACTION

Indicates event or todo was sent out.
SENT

Indicates event is tentatively accepted
TENTATIVE

Indicates event is confirmed
CONFIRMED

Indicates event or todo has been declined
DECLINED

Indicates todo has been completed
COMPLETED

Indicates event or todo has been delegated
DELEGATED


The default value for this property is NEEDS ACTION.
Support for this property is mandatory for implementations conforming to this specification.
Summary
This property is identified by the property name SUMMARY. This property defines a short summary or subject of the vCalendar entity. The following is an example of this property:
SUMMARY:Department Party
Support for this property is mandatory for implementations conforming to this specification.
Time Transparency
This property is identified by the property name TRANSP. This property defines whether the event is transparent to free time searches. The value of this property is a number. A value of zero (ASCII decimal 48) guaranttes that the entry will blocks time and will be factored into a free time search. A value of one (ASCII decimal 49) specifies that the entry will not block time and will not be factored into a free time search. Any values greater than "1" will provide implementation specific transparency semantics. Some implementations may treat values greater than one as non-blocking or transparent events. Other implementations may use the numeric value to provide a layering of levels of transparency. The default value is zero (ASCII decimal 48), the event is not transparent and will block free time searches. The following is an example of this property:
TRANSP:0
Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Uniform Resource Locator
This property is identified by the property name URL. This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator for an Internet location that can be used to obtain real-time information associated with the vCalendar entity. Valid values for this property are a string conforming to the IETF RFC 1738, Uniform Resource Locators. The following is an example of this property:
URL:http://abc.com/pub/calendars/jsmith/mytime.or3
Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Unique Identifier
This property is identified by the property name UID. This property defines a persistent, globally unique identifier associated with the vCalendar entity. Some examples of forms of unique identifiers would include ISO 9070 formal public identifiers (FPI), X.500 distinguished names, machine-generated "random" numbers with a statistically high likelihood of being globally unique and Uniform Resource Locators (URL). If an URL is specified, it is suggested that the URL reference a service which can render an updated version of the vCalendar for the object. The following is an example of this property:
UID:19960401-080045-4000F192713-0052
This property is an important method for group scheduling applications to match calendar entities with later modification or deletion requests. Calendaring applications that do not generate this property in vCalendar entities may be limiting their interoperability with other group scheduling applications.
Support for this property is optional for implementations conforming to this specification.
Miscellaneous Properties
Extensions
The clear-text encoding provides a "standard mechanism for doing non-standard things". This extension support is provided for implementers to "push the envelope" on the existing version of the specification. Extension properties are specified by property and/or property parameter names that have the initial sub-string of X- (the two character sequence: Capital X character followed by the Dash character). It is recommended that vendors concatenate onto this sentinel an added short sub-string to identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different vendors. All vCalendar Readers are expected to be able to interpret the extension properties and property parameters but may ignore them. The following might be the ABC vendor's extension for an audio-clip form of subject property:
X-ABC-MMSUBJ;TYPE=WAV; VALUE=URL: http://load.noise.org/mysubj.wav
At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension properties.
Support for this property is mandatory for implementations conforming to this specification. However, an implementation may not be able to act on the extension property. Conformance only requires that an implementation be able to parse vCalendar data streams with extensions. The implementation need not act on them.
Formal Definition
The following modified Backus-Naur Notation (BNF) is provided to assist developers in building parsers for the clear-text encoding.

This syntax is written according to the form described in RFC 822,
but it references just this small subset of RFC 822 literals:
  CR          =  <ASCII CR, carriage return>  ; (     15,      13.)
  LF          =  <ASCII LF, linefeed>         ; (     12,      10.)
  CRLF	     =  CR LF
  SPACE       =  <ASCII SP, space>            ; (     40,      32.)
  HTAB        =  <ASCII HT, horizontal-tab>   ; (     11,       9.)

All literal property names are valid as upper, lower, or mixed case.

Section 3 : Internet Recommendations
[DS3]	1	
Recommended Practice With SMTP/MIME
The vCalendar information can be transported through SMTP/MIME based electronic mail services. Interoperability of vCalendar information over SMTP/MIME transports can be better assured by following a common set of recommended practices for encapsulation of the vCalendar.
Text/Plain Content Type
Without any change to existing SMTP or MIME compliant user agents, a vCalendar object can be included within Internet email messages. This might be the case for an existing, simple user agent such as a legacy SMTP mail system. While this approach provides for transport of vCalendars over SMTP services, it does not allow for the end user to take advantage of the full capabilities of either the vCalendar or Internet email (i.e., MIME) functionality.
The following demonstrates how a vCalendar can be included as a SMTP message made up of a RFC 822 message. This may be an initial method for incorporating vCalendar objects into SMTP messages.

Text/X-vCalendar Content Type
The vCalendar object can also be passed as a non-standard MIME media type. This would be useful in order to clearly identify the vCalendar object in an electronic mail message body part. A non-standard, vCalendar object should be identified as the MIME type/subtype "text/x-vCalendar".
The following example demonstrates how a vCalendar containing both an event and a todo can be included as a separate text/x-vCalendar content portion within a MIME user agent.

Recommended Practice With HTTP/HTML
The vCalendar specification provides a useful format for conveying calendaring and scheduling information between a Web browser and a HTTP server. Homepages can be used as a web-based document for publishing public events. The events can be easily formatted into vCalendar objects for transfer between the server and a requesting browser. The following examples are provided to illustrate possible scenarios where  a non-standard "text/x-vCalendar" MIME type/subtype corresponding the vCalendar can be used to transfer calendaring and scheduling information across the World Wide Web.
The following example demonstrates how a vCalendar object can be included in an HTML document or Web page. This may be an initial method for incorporating vCalendar objects into Web pages. This sample assumes that the Web Browser is capable of handling the OBJECT HTML 3.2 element.
<html>
<head>
<title>HTTP/Web vCalendar Example</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1>Special <i>New</i> Events</h1>
<h3>The latest events to be added to the calendar of activities are:</h3>
<hr>
<center>
<object data=martin.vcs type="text/x-vCalendar">
Your browser does not support OBJECT or the text/x-vCalendar MIME type/subtype.  Get the events' data <a href=martin.vcs>here</a> and manually use it.
</object>

Section 4 : UI Support Recommendations
[DS4]		
When  integrating vCalendar support into an application, an implementor needs to consider a number of user interface (UI) implications. Most applications provide some levels of support for interacting with other applications. This is usually accomplished in three ways. These include the File System, Clipboard, and Drag/Drop. The full potential of the vCalendar technology can be better utilized if an application supports the vCalendar in each of these UI actions.
File System
It is recommended that applications integrating support for vCalendar specification provide support for importing and exporting vCalendar objects from the operating system's file system. In operating systems that support file types, it is recommended that a file type of VCS be used to distinguish the vCalendar objects. Applications should make use of the file system capabilities to support the FileOpen and FileSaveAs, or their equivalent function, of a vCalendar object.
Clipboard
It is recommended that applications integrating support for the vCalendar specification provide UI capabilities for exchanging vCalendar objects through the operating system's clipboard. In operating systems that provide support for registering clipboard format types, it is recommended that the vCalendar object be registered using the string +//ISBN 1-887687-00-9::versit::PDI//vCalendar. This string is an ISO 9070 Formal Public Identifier (FPI). Applications should make use of the operating system's clipboard capability to support the Cut, Copy, and Paste, or their equivalent function, of a vCalendar object. Applications copying a vCalendar to the clipboard should put the vCalendar object on to the clipboard in both the vCalendar registered format and a plain text format.
Drag/Drop
It is recommended that applications integrating support for the vCalendar specification provide UI capabilities for exchanging vCalendar objects through the operating system's drag/drop capability. In operating systems that provide support for registering drag/drop object types, it is recommended that the vCalendar object be registered using the string +//ISBN 1-887687-00-9::versit::PDI//vCalendar. This string is an ISO 9070 Formal Public Identifier (FPI). Applications should make use of the operating system's drag/drop capability to enable the application to act as either a Drag Source and Drag Target, or their equivalent function, of a vCalendar object. Applications acting as a Drag Source should advertise their ability to render the vCalendar in both the vCalendar registered format and a plain text format.
Where an operating system environment provided multiple drag/drop protocols (e.g., file specification or clipboard based), it is recommended that an implementation provide negotiated support for both. For example, the file specification based drag/drop protocol is useful when dragging a desktop file object or a web based URL to a target application. In addition, the clipboard based drag/drop protocol is useful when dragging an event or todo from a source within an application to a target in another application. Supporting just one of these mechanisms will unnecessarily lead to a lack of interoperability between applications supporting this specifications. 
Section 5 : Conformance
[DS5]		
In order for a vCalendar Reader or Writer to conform to this specification it must meet the following criteria:
All properties must be implemented as defined. Statements elsewhere in the specification which describe features as optional or with exceptions take precedence over this criterion.
Character set support is up to the underlying implementation. However, support for the default character set (i.e., US ASCII) is required. Optionally, other character sets may be supported.
All extensions are optional. It is requested that any vendor-specific extensions include the vendor identification sub-string in the extension name. For example, the extension name X-ABC- for an extension created by the ABC organization.
All vendor defined extensions must declare the minimum conformance for that extension.

Section 6 : Extended Recurrence Grammar
[DS6]		

The material in this section is included in this specification for reference information.It is copied, with permission of the XAPIA, from the XAPIA Calendaring and Sceduling API (CSA) Specification. This section defines an extended recurrence rule grammar that may be useful to implementations wishing to extend the capability of the basic recurrence rule defined by this specification. The material is equally applicable to extended support of the exception rules for repeating events.
Rule Introduction
A recurrence rule is made up of one or more recurrence frequencies. The frequencies express the granularity of the repeating event. The smallest granularity is based on minutes, the largest is based on years. Each frequency is immediately followed by an interval. The interval helps to define how often the frequency repeats (daily, every third day, etc):
D2
Where, where D is the Frequency and 2 is the Interval.
M5	Repeat every five minutes 
D1	Repeat daily  
D2	Repeat every other day
D3	Repeat every third day
W1	Repeat weekly 
W2	Repeat every other week  
W3	Repeat every third week  
The meaning of the interval depends on the frequency. As an example, the 5 in M5 is in minutes while the 3 in D3 is in days.
A rule can end with the duration symbol, #, followed by a number. This defines the number of times the repetition occurs (including the first time).
D2 #5
Where, #5 is the Duration. In this example, the event occurs every other day and the duration indicates it occur 5 times.
There may be other information between the frequency and the duration that supplements the meaning of the rule:
D2 1200 1600 #5
In this example, the event occurs every other day at 1200 and 1600 for a total of 10 occurrences. The duration controls the number of times the rule occurs. In this case the rule defines two occurrences (1200 and 1600) so a total of 10 (2 x 5) occurrences are generated.
A rule can be made up of several recurrence rules: 
MP6 1+ MO #5 D2 1200 1600 #5 M5 #3
This recurrence rule is made up of three recurrence rules. Every time the first rule executes (every 6 months) it executes the next rule to the right. If there is not a rule to the right an event is generated. In this case there is a daily frequency rule to the right of the monthly frequency rule. It executes twice a day; starting on the first Monday of the month. The daily frequency rule executes a total of ten times. Since there is a rule following the daily rule it executes it each time the daily frequency rule executes. The minute frequency rule is executed three times, every time the daily frequency rule executes, for a total of six times a day. The  ROWSPAN="2" WIDTH="17%">19:</TD>

Section 4 : UI Support Recommendations
[DS4]		
When  integrating vCalendar support into an application, an implementor needs to consider a number of user interface (UI) implications. Most applications provide some levels of support for interacting with other applications. This is usually accomplished in three ways. These include the File System, Clipboard, and Drag/Drop. The full potential of the vCalendar technology can be better utilized if an application supports the vCalendar in each of these UI actions.
File System
It is recommended that applications integrating support for vCalendar specification provide support for importing and exporting vCalendar objects from the operating system's file system. In operating systems that support file types, it is recommended that a file type of VCS be used to distinguish the vCalendar objects. Applications should make use of the file system capabilities to support the FileOpen and FileSaveAs, or their equivalent function, of a vCalendar object.
Clipboard
It is recommended that applications integrating support for the vCalendar specification provide UI capabilities for exchanging vCalendar objects through the operating system's clipboard. In operating systems that provide support for registering clipboard format types, it is recommended that the vCalendar object be registered using the string +//ISBN 1-887687-00-9::versit::PDI//vCalendar. This string is an ISO 9070 Formal Public Identifier (FPI). Applications should make use of the operating system's clipboard capability to support the Cut, Copy, and Paste, or their equivalent function, of a vCalendar object. Applications copying a vCalendar to the clipboard should put the vCalendar object on to the clipboard in both the vCalendar registered format and a plain text format.
Drag/Drop
It is recommended that applications integrating support for the vCalendar specification provide UI capabilities for exchanging vCalendar objects through the operating system's drag/drop capability. In operating systems that provide support for registering drag/drop object types, it is recommended that the vCalendar object be registered using the string +//ISBN 1-887687-00-9::versit::PDI//vCalendar. This string is an ISO 9070 Formal Public Identifier (FPI). Applications should make use of the operating system's drag/drop capability to enable the application to act as either a Drag Source and Drag Target, or their equivalent function, of a vCalendar object. Applications acting as a Drag Source should advertise their ability to render the vCalendar in both the vCalendar registered format and a plain text format.
Where an operating system environment provided multiple drag/drop protocols (e.g., file specification or clipboard based), it is recommend days of the year. 
Policies
The duration portion of a rule defines the total number of occurrences the rule generates, including the first event. As an example, the rule MP1 #3 W1 #3 starting on 1/1/94 would generate occurrences on 1/1/94, 1/8, 1/15, 2/5/94, 2/12, 2/19, 3/5/94, 3/12, 3/19.
The duration granularity is defined by the recurrence frequency immediately preceding the duration portion of the rule. For example, D1 #5 M15 #4 establishes a repeating event which happens for five days, four times per day.  
Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the next event time and date is derived from the event start time. 
If no specific time is indicated in the recurrence rule it is taken from the event.
If an end date and a duration for the first rule in a nested rule are specified in the rule, then the recurring event ceases when the end date is reached or the number of occurrences indicated in the duration occur; whichever comes first. 
If the duration or and end date is not established in the rule (e.g. ``D2'') the event occurs twice. That is D2 is equivalent to D2 #2.
If an endmark is used in a second or later rule of a nested rule, then the endmark is applied each time that rule is executed by the previous rule. YM1 1 6 #1 MD1 7$ 14 generates occurrences on 1/7 1/14 2/7 6/7 6/14 7/7. 
If an endmark is used on a day of the week which is followed by several times (TU$ 1200 1300) or an endmark is used on a week occurrence that is followed by several weekdays (1+$ TU WE) the repeating event stops after the last time or week day in the list is executed. 
If a rule has an ambiguity with respect to whether it will repeat on a specific day (12th of the month) vs on a relative day (2nd Friday of the month), the specific day takes precedence. The only exception to this policy is policy 14. 
A duration of #0 means repeat this event forever. 
Nested rules can not have a duration of 0. These are not allowed: 

	YM1 6 #10 MP1 1+ SA #0
	D5 0600 0800 #5 M5 #0
Using the occurrence specifier 5+ (e.g. 5th Friday) or 5- (e.g. 5th from last Friday) in a month that does not contain 5 weeks does not generate an event and thus does not count against the duration. The same applies to providing a day of the month that does not occur in the month: 31st.
The start time and date of an event must be in-sync with one of the event slots defined by its ocurrence rule. The following are not allowed:

	Initial Appt Time:	1300
	Recurrence Rule:		D1 1400 #5
	Initial Appt Date:	7/1/94 (Friday)
	Recurrence Rule:		W1 MO TH #5

The following are acceptable:

	Initial Appt Time:	1300
	Recurrence Rule:		D1 #5 or D1 1300 #5
	Initial Appt Date:	7/1/94 (Friday)
	Recurrence Rule:		W1 MO FR #5 or W1 #5
If the optional <weekdaytime> information is missing from a <monthlybypos> frequency, the information is derived from the initial event. The <occurrence> used in the recurring event is a count from the beginning of the month to the event date and the <weekday> used is the day of the week the initial event is scheduled to occur on. If the <monthlybypos> frequency does not list a week day (e.g. SU) in the rule, then the week day is established from the initial event information. As an example, the rule MP1 #3 used in an event with a start date of 7/20/94 (which is the third Wed of the month) will repeat on 8/17/94 which is the third Wed of the month.
The next event of a higher order rule does not execute until all the occurrences of a subrule are generated. If the next event of a higher order rule comes earlier in time than the last event of a subrule then the missed occurrences are not generated. In other words, subrules can not interleave occurrences with other subrules. The following results in indeterminate results because the minute subrule which begins to execute at 0630 generates occurrences beyond 0700 which is when the daily subrule begins executing again:

	D1 0630 0700 #4 M45 #5

Another incorrect rule: 

	MP1 1+ 1- #3 W2 TU TH #5

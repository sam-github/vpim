4.3.10 Recurrence Rule

   Value Name: RECUR

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a recurrence rule specification.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     recur      = "FREQ"=freq *(

                ; either UNTIL or COUNT may appear in a 'recur',
                ; but UNTIL and COUNT MUST NOT occur in the same 'recur'

                ( ";" "UNTIL" "=" enddate ) /
                ( ";" "COUNT" "=" 1*DIGIT ) /

                ; the rest of these keywords are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                ( ";" "INTERVAL" "=" 1*DIGIT )          /
                ( ";" "BYSECOND" "=" byseclist )        /

                ( ";" x-name "=" text )
                )

     freq       = "SECONDLY" / "MINUTELY" / "HOURLY" / "DAILY"
                / "WEEKLY" / "MONTHLY" / "YEARLY"

     enddate    = date
     enddate    =/ date-time            ;An UTC value

     byseclist  = seconds / ( seconds *("," seconds) )

     seconds    = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT       ;0 to 59

     byminlist  = minutes / ( minutes *("," minutes) )

     minutes    = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT       ;0 to 59

     byhrlist   = hour / ( hour *("," hour) )

     hour       = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT       ;0 to 23

     bywdaylist = weekdaynum / ( weekdaynum *("," weekdaynum) )

     weekdaynum = [([plus] ordwk / minus ordwk)] weekday

     plus       = "+"

     minus      = "-"

     ordwk      = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT       ;1 to 53

     weekday    = "SU" / "MO" / "TU" / "WE" / "TH" / "FR" / "SA"
     ;Corresponding to SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY,
     ;FRIDAY, SATURDAY and SUNDAY days of the week.

     bymodaylist = monthdaynum / ( monthdaynum *("," monthdaynum) )

     monthdaynum = ([plus] ordmoday) / (minus ordmoday)

     ordmoday   = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT       ;1 to 31

     byyrdaylist = yeardaynum / ( yeardaynum *("," yeardaynum) )

     yeardaynum = ([plus] ordyrday) / (minus ordyrday)

     ordyrday   = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT / 3DIGIT      ;1 to 366

     bywknolist = weeknum / ( weeknum *("," weeknum) )

     weeknum    = ([plus] ordwk) / (minus ordwk)

     bymolist   = monthnum / ( monthnum *("," monthnum) )

     monthnum   = 1DIGIT / 2DIGIT       ;1 to 12

     bysplist   = setposday / ( setposday *("," setposday) )

     setposday  = yeardaynum

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "recur" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. The value type is a structured value consisting of a list
   of one or more recurrence grammar parts. Each rule part is defined by
   a NAME=VALUE pair. The rule parts are separated from each other by
   the SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59). The rule parts are not
   ordered in any particular sequence. Individual rule parts MUST only
   be specified once.

   The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule. This rule
   part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule. Valid values include
   SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a
   second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based on an
   interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating events
   based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify repeating
   events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to specify
   repeating events based on an interval of a week or more; MONTHLY, to
   specify repeating events based on an interval of a month or more; and
   YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a year or
   more.

   The INTERVAL rule part contains a positive integer representing how
   often the recurrence rule repeats. The default value is "1", meaning
   every second for a SECONDLY rule, or every minute for a MINUTELY
   rule, every hour for an HOURLY rule, every day for a DAILY rule,
   every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a MONTHLY rule and
   every year for a YEARLY rule.

   The UNTIL rule part defines a date-time value which bounds the
   recurrence rule in an inclusive manner. If the value specified by
   UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence, this date or
   date-time becomes the last instance of the recurrence. If specified
   as a date-time value, then it MUST be specified in an UTC time
   format. If not present, and the COUNT rule part is also not present,
   the RRULE is considered to repeat forever.

   The COUNT rule part defines the number of occurrences at which to
   range-bound the recurrence. The "DTSTART" property value, if
   specified, counts as the first occurrence.

   The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of seconds within a minute. Valid values are 0 to
   59. The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44) separated list of minutes within an hour. Valid values
   are 0 to 59. The BYHOUR rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-
   ASCII decimal 44) separated list of hours of the day. Valid values
   are 0 to 23.

   The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of days of the week; MO indicates Monday; TU indicates
   Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH indicates Thursday; FR indicates
   Friday; SA indicates Saturday; SU indicates Sunday.

   Each BYDAY value can also be preceded by a positive (+n) or negative
   (-n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY RRULE. For example, within
   a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO) represents the first Monday
   within the month, whereas -1MO represents the last Monday of the
   month. If an integer modifier is not present, it means all days of
   this type within the specified frequency. For example, within a
   MONTHLY rule, MO represents all Mondays within the month.

   The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31 or
   -31 to -1. For example, -10 represents the tenth to the last day of
   the month.

   The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the year. Valid values are 1 to 366 or
   -366 to -1. For example, -1 represents the last day of the year
   (December 31st) and -306 represents the 306th to the last day of the
   year (March 1st).

   The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the year. Valid
   values are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1. This corresponds to weeks according
   to week numbering as defined in [ISO 8601]. A week is defined as a
   seven day period, starting on the day of the week defined to be the
   week start (see WKST). Week number one of the calendar year is the
   first week which contains at least four (4) days in that calendar
   year. This rule part is only valid for YEARLY rules. For example, 3
   represents the third week of the year.

        Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when
        Thursday is January 1 or if it is a leap year and Wednesday is
        January 1.

   The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of months of the year. Valid values are 1 to 12.

   The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts.
   Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA and SU. This is significant
   when a WEEKLY RRULE has an interval greater than 1, and a BYDAY rule
   part is specified. This is also significant when in a YEARLY RRULE
   when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified. The default value is MO.

   The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of values which corresponds to the nth occurrence
   within the set of events specified by the rule. Valid values are 1 to
   366 or -366 to -1. It MUST only be used in conjunction with another
   BYxxx rule part. For example "the last work day of the month" could
   be represented as:

     RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1

   Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+n) or negative (-n)
   integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific occurrence within the set of events specified by the rule.

   If BYxxx rule part values are found which are beyond the available
   scope (ie, BYMONTHDAY=30 in February), they are simply ignored.

   Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
   various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from the
   Start Time (DTSTART) entry attribute. For example,
   "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1" doesn't specify a specific day within the
   month or a time. This information would be the same as what is
   specified for DTSTART.

   BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner. BYxxx rule
   parts for a period of time which is the same or greater than the
   frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of the
   recurrence generated. For example, "FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1" reduces the
   number of recurrence instances from all days (if BYMONTH tag is not
   present) to all days in January. BYxxx rule parts for a period of
   time less than the frequency generally increase or expand the number
   of occurrences of the recurrence. For example,
   "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2" increases the number of days within the
   yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH tag is not present) to 2.

   If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating the
   specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts are
   applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the following
   order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, BYHOUR,
   BYMINUTE, BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are evaluated.

   Here is an example of evaluating multiple BYxxx rule parts.

     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970105T083000
     RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=2;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU;BYHOUR=8,9;
      BYMINUTE=30

   First, the "INTERVAL=2" would be applied to "FREQ=YEARLY" to arrive
   at "every other year". Then, "BYMONTH=1" would be applied to arrive
   at "every January, every other year". Then, "BYDAY=SU" would be
   applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January, every other year".
   Then, "BYHOUR=8,9" would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in
   January at 8 AM and 9 AM, every other year". Then, "BYMINUTE=30"
   would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January at 8:30 AM and
   9:30 AM, every other year". Then, lacking information from RRULE, the
   second is derived from DTSTART, to end up in "every Sunday in January
   at 8:30:00 AM and 9:30:00 AM, every other year". Similarly, if the
   BYMINUTE, BYHOUR, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY or BYMONTH rule part were
   missing, the appropriate minute, hour, day or month would have been
   retrieved from the "DTSTART" property.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example: The following is a rule which specifies 10 meetings which
   occur every other day:

     FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10;INTERVAL=2

   There are other examples specified in the "RRULE" specification.




4.8.5.4 Recurrence Rule

   Property Name: RRULE

   Purpose: This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for
   recurring events, to-dos, or time zone definitions.

   Value Type: RECUR

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified one or more times in
   recurring "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar components. It
   can also be specified once in each STANDARD or DAYLIGHT sub-component
   of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.

   Description: The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
   the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
   recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
   generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
   the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained
   within the iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first
   instance in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and
   "EXRULE" properties can also be specified to define more
   sophisticated recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated
   by gathering all of the start date/times generated by any of the
   specified "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start
   date/times which fall within the union of start date/times generated
   by any specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that
   start date/times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
   and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The "DTSTART" and "DTEND" property pair or "DTSTART" and "DURATION"
   property pair, specified within the iCalendar object defines the
   first instance of the recurrence. When used with a recurrence rule,
   the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties MUST be specified in local time
   and the appropriate set of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components MUST be
   included. For detail on the usage of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component, see the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component definition.

   Any duration associated with the iCalendar object applies to all
   members of the generated recurrence set. Any modified duration for
   specific recurrences MUST be explicitly specified using the "RDATE"
   property.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

     rrule      = "RRULE" rrulparam ":" recur CRLF

     rrulparam  = *(";" xparam)

   Example: All examples assume the Eastern United States time zone.

Daylight Saving Time begins for most of the United States at 2 a.m. on the
first Sunday of April. Time reverts to standard time at 2 a.m. on the last
Sunday of October. In the U.S., each time zone switches at a different time. 

In the European Union, Summer Time begins and ends at 1 am Universal Time
(Greenwich Mean Time). It starts the last Sunday in March, and ends the last
Sunday in October. In the EU, all time zones change at the same moment.

   An example where the days generated makes a difference because of
   WKST:

     changing only WKST from MO to SU, yields different results...

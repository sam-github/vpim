   status        ; y            4.8.1.11  TEXT, different values defined for event, todo, journal

      Event: TENTATIVE, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED

      Journal: DRAFT, FINAL, CANCELLED

   dtstart       ; y  DTSTART   4.8.2.4   DATE-TIME is default, value=date can be set
   dtend         ; y  DTEND     4.8.2.2   Unless it has Z (UTC), or a tzid, then it is local-time.

   dtstamp       ; y  DTSTAMP   4.8.7.2   DATE-TIME, creation time, inclusion is mandatory, but what does
     it mean? It seems to be when the icalendar was actually created (as opposed to when the user entered
     the information into the calendar database, for example), but in that case my Apple icalendars should
     have all components having the same DTSTAMP, but they don't!

   duration      ; y  DURATION  4.8.2.5   dur-value

     dur-value  = (["+"] / "-") "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

     dur-date   = dur-day [dur-time]
                = 1*DIGIT "D" [ dur-time ]
                
     dur-time   = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
                = "T" (
                    1*DIGIT "H" [ 1*DIGIT "M" [ 1*DIGIT "S" ] ] /
                                  1*DIGIT "M" [ 1*DIGIT "S" ]   /
                                                1*DIGIT "S"
                    )

     dur-week   = 1*DIGIT "W"
     dur-day    = 1*DIGIT "D"
     dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
     dur-minute = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
     dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"

     The EBNF is complicated, because they want to say that /some/ component
     must be present, and that if you have a "T", you need a time after it,
     and that you can't have an hour followed by seconds with no intervening
     minutes... but we don't care about that during decoding, so we rewrite
     the EBNF as:

     dur-value = ["+" / "-"] "P" [ 1*DIGIT "W" ] [ 1*DIGIT "D" ] [ "T" [ 1*DIGIT "H" ]  [ 1*DIGIT "M" ] [ 1*DIGIT "S" ] ]

   uid           ; y  UID       4.8.4.7   TEXT, recommended to generate them in RFC822 form

   rrule         ; y  RRULE     4.8.5.4   RECUR, can occur multiple times!

   

VEVENT Ifx:

  TEXT: summary, description, comment, location, uid

  think about:  uid

  Vevent#status -> The status, upper-case.
  Vevent#status= -> set a new status, only allow the defined statuses!
  Vevent#status?(s) -> check if the status is s

  can contain alarms... should it include an alarms module?

vPim provides calendaring, scheduling, and contact support for Ruby through the
standard iCalendar and vCard data formats for "personal information" exchange.

= Thanks

- http://ZipDX.com: for sponsoring development of FREQ=weekly and BYSETPOS in
  recurrence rules.
- http://RubyForge.org: for their generous hosting of this project.

= Installation

There is a vPim package installable using ruby-gems:

  # gem install vpim (may require root privilege)

= Overview

vCard (RFC 2426) is a format for personal information, see Vpim::Vcard and
Vpim::Maker::Vcard.

iCalendar (RFC 2445) is a format for calendar related information, see
Vpim::Icalendar.

vCard and iCalendar support is built on top of an implementation of the MIME
Content-Type for Directory Information (RFC 2425). The basic RFC 2425 format is
implemented by  Vpim::DirectoryInfo and Vpim::DirectoryInfo::Field.

The libary is quite useful, but improvements are ongoing.  If you find
something missing or have suggestions, please contact me. I can't promise
instantaneous turnaround, but I might be able to suggest another approach, and
features requested by users of vPim go to the top of the todo list. If you need
a feature for a commercial project, consider sponsoring development.

= Examples

Here's an example to give a sense for how iCalendars are encoded and decoded:

  require 'vpim/icalendar'

  cal = Vpim::Icalendar.create2

  cal.add_event do |e|
    e.dtstart       Date.new(2005, 04, 28)
    e.dtend         Date.new(2005, 04, 29)
    e.summary       "Monthly meet-the-CEO day"
    e.description <<'---'
  Unlike last one, this meeting will change your life because
  we are going to discuss your likely demotion if your work isn't
  done soon.
  ---
    e.categories    [ 'APPOINTMENT' ]
    e.categories do |c| c.push 'EDUCATION' end
    e.url           'http://www.example.com'
    e.sequence      0
    e.access_class  "PRIVATE"
    e.transparency  'OPAQUE'

    now = Time.now
    e.created       now
    e.lastmod       now


    e.organizer do |o|
      o.cn = "Example Organizer, Mr."
      o.uri = "mailto:organizer@example.com"
    end

    attendee = Vpim::Icalendar::Address.create("mailto:attendee@example.com")
    attendee.rsvp = true
    e.add_attendee attendee
  end

  icsfile = cal.encode

  puts '--- Encode:'

  puts icsfile

  puts '--- Decode:'

  cal = Vpim::Icalendar.decode(icsfile).first

  cal.components do |e|
    puts e.summary
    puts e.description
    puts e.dtstart.to_s
    puts e.dtend.to_s
  end

This produces:

iCalendar examples are:
- link:ics-to-rss.txt: prints todos as RSS, or starts a WEBrick servlet
  that publishes todos as a RSS feed. Thanks to Dave Thomas for this idea,
  from http://pragprog.com/pragdave/Tech/Blog/ToDos.rdoc.
- link:cmd-itip.txt: prints emailed iCalendar invitations in human-readable
  form, and see link:README.mutt for instruction on mutt integration. I get
  a lot of meeting invitations from Lotus Notes/Domino users at work, and
  this is pretty useful in figuring out where and when I am supposed to be.
- link:reminder.txt: prints upcoming events and todos, by default from
  Apple's iCal calendars

- link:ics-dump.txt: utility for dumping contents of .ics files

todo:
 - calendar as Atom
 - limit calendar to events at a particular time period
 - birthdays as calendar with alarm

CalendarWindow
  cal
  start->end
  filter_complete?

  #components
	Hack events so serialized.
	Put everything without a timestamp first, then timestamped.
	Proxy everything.

Atomize
  All todo/event components, in order.

Make an ics-to-rss.

Calendar:

  Need a Calendar wrapper that filters events, todos, etc. based on window

== RESTful path ideas

/calendars/coding/month/atom
/calendars/coding/month/rss
/calendars/coding/events/month/ics              <- next month?
/calendars/coding/events/month/2008-04/ics      <- a specified month?

/calendars/coding/week/atom

/calendars/year/rss

  what does blogger do with blog titles?

  #month/atom
  #month  -> html
